# IdiomaticReact

**Idiomatic React** aims to be the simplest API-centric Flux app one could build using React.

Currently, it uses :

* [React](http://facebook.github.io/react/) with [JSX](https://facebook.github.io/jsx/);
* [Flummox](https://github.com/acdlite/flummox) ([Flux](http://facebook.github.io/flux/) implementation) for the stores;
* [React-Router](https://github.com/rackt/react-router);
* [Immutable.js](http://facebook.github.io/immutable-js/) for immutability in the stores;
* [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for ES6/ES7 transpilation and linting;
* [Webpack](http://webpack.github.io/) for the tooling and workflow management.

## Install & run

```
npm install
grunt serve

## Features

* Routing, with stateful navigation bar
* ES6/ES7 transpilation to ES5, allowing ES6 constructs and ES7 `await/async` in the code
* REST API adapter to I/O data, bufferring in stores
* Immutable stores

## Motive

Considering the frequent mutation of technology happening on the React scene, we believe developers might feel the need for a simple, idiomatic app reflecting the current state of the technology and techniques, be it for bootstrapping awesome apps, or simply to improve their skills.

This project **aims** to be simple **and** idiomatic. We're not there yet, and we rely heavily on contributors (on you !) to make this happen.
